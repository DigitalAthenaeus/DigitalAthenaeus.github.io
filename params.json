{"name":"Digital Athenaeus","tagline":"A digital edition of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis","body":"The _Digital Athenaeus_ is a project led by [Monica Berti](http://www.monicaberti.com/) at the Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig for producing a digital edition of the _Deipnosophists_ of Athenaeus of Naucratis.\r\n\r\nThe _Deipnosophists_ (_Δειπνοσοφισταί_, or _Sophists at Dinner_, in fifteen books) was composed by Athenaeus of Naucratis between the 2nd and the 3rd century CE and it is the description of several banquet conversations on food, literature, and arts held in Rome by twenty-two learned men. This complex and fascinating work is not only an erudite and literary encyclopedia of a myriad of curiosities about classical antiquity, but also an invaluable collection of quotations of ancient authors, ranging from Homer to tragic and comic poets and lost historians. Since the large majority of the works cited by Athenaeus is nowadays lost, this compilation is a sort of reference tool for every scholar of Greek theater, poetry, historiography, botany, zoology, and many other topics.\r\n\r\n### Digital Athenaeus Repositories\r\n* [athenaeus-dev](http://opengreekandlatin.github.io/athenaeus-dev/): A machine-corrected EpiDoc version of the works of Athenaeus of Naucratis.\r\n","google":"UA-70680383-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
